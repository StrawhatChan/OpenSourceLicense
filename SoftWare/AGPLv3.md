Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

> 每个人都可以复制和分发此许可证文件的逐字副本，但不允许更改。

## Preamble
> 前言

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
> GNU Affero通用公共许可证是软件和其他类型作品的免费版权许可证，专门用于确保与网络服务器软件的社区合作。

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
> 大多数软件和其他实用作品的许可证旨在剥夺您分享和更改作品的自由。相比之下，我们的通用公共许可证旨在保证您自由共享和更改所有版本的程序 - 以确保它仍然是所有用户的免费软件。

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
> 当我们谈到自由软件时，我们指的是自由，而不是价格。我们的通用公共许可证旨在确保您可以自由发布免费软件副本（如果您愿意，还可以收费），这些免费软件副本是指，您收到的源代码或可以获取到的、您可以改变软件或在新的免费程序中使用它的一部分，以及你知道你可以做这些事情。

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
> 使用我们的通用公共许可证的开发人员通过两个步骤保护您的权利：（1）声明软件的版权，以及（2）为您提供本许可证，使您可以复制，分发和/或修改软件。

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate.Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation.However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.
> 捍卫所有用户的自由的另一个好处是，如果程序的其他版本得到了广泛使用，那么其他开发人员可以使用这些版本进行改进，许多免费软件开发人员都受此鼓舞。然而，在网络服务器上使用软件的情况下，这个结果可能会失败。GNU通用公共许可证允许制作修改后的版本，并允许公众在服务器上访问它，而不向公众发布其源代码。

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community.It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server.Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.
> GNU Affero通用公共许可证专门用于确保在这种情况下，经过修改的源代码可供社区使用。它要求网络服务器的运营商提供运行在那里的修改版本的源代码给使用者。因此，在可公开访问的服务器上，可以让公众访问修改后的版本的源代码。

An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.
> 一个名为Affero General Public License并由Affero发布的旧许可证旨在实现类似的目标。这是一个不同的许可证，而不是Affero GPL的一个版本，但Affero已经发布了Affero GPL的新版本，允许根据此许可证重新授权 。

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
> 以下是复制、分发和修改的准确条款和条件。

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 条款与条件

0. Definitions.
> 0. 定义

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
> “本许可证”是指GNU Affero通用公共许可证的第3版。

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
> “版权”也意味着适用于其他作品的版权法律，例如半导体口罩。

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.Each licensee is addressed as "you"."Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
> “本程序”是指根据本许可证获得许可的任何着作权作品。每个许可证持有者均以“您”的身份发布。“许可证持有者”和“收件人”可以是个人或组织。

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
> “修改”作品指的是以需要版权许可的方式复制或修改全部或部分作品，而不是制作完全相同的作品。所得作品被称为早期作品的“修改版本”或“基于”早期作品的作品。

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
> “覆盖的作品”是指未修改的程序或基于程序的作品。

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
> “传播”作品意味着未经许可的情况下，对其做任何事情，可能会使您直接或次要地承担适用版权法下的侵权责任，但在计算机上执行或修改私人副本除外。传播包括复制、分发（无论是否修改）以及向公众和一些国家提供其他活动。

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
> “传达”作品意味着任何形式的传播，使其他方可以制作或接收副本。不会传输副本，仅通过计算机网络与用户进行单纯的交互，并不是传达。

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
> 交互式用户界面显示“适当的法律声明”，只要它包含方便且显着的可见功能（1）显示适当的版权声明，和（2）告诉用户该作品没有担保（除提供担保的范围），被许可人可以根据本许可转达作品，以及如何查看本许可的副本。如果界面提供用户命令或选项列表，例如菜单，列表中的突出项目符合此标准。

1. Source Code.
> 1. 源代码

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it."Object code" means any non-source form of a work.
> 作品的“源代码”是指对作品进行修改的首选形式。“对象代码”是指作品的任何非源代码形式。

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. 
> “标准接口”是指一个接口，它既可以是由公认的标准机构定义的官方标准，也可以是为特定编程语言指定的接口，而是在使用该语言的开发人员中广泛使用的接口。

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
> 可执行作品的“系统库”指的不是整个作品，而是其他任何事物，包括（a）打包1个主要组件的正常形式，但不是该主要组件的任一部分，以及（b）使应用该主要组件的作品可用，或者实施一个标准接口，以源代码形式向公众提供可用的实施。在这种情况下，“主要组件”指的是特定操作系统（如果有）的一个主要核心组件（内核 、视窗系统等），可执行作品运行在特定操作系统之上，或者是产生作品的编译器，或者是对象代码的解释器。

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
> 对象代码形式作品的“对应源”指的是生成、安装和（对于可执行作品）运行对象代码和修改作品所需的所有源代码，包括用于控制这些活动的脚本，但是，它不包括作品的系统库，或通用工具或通常可用的免费程序，这些程序在执行这些活动时未被修改，但不属于该工作的一部分。例如，对应源包括作品中与源文件相关的接口定义文件，以及共享库和为作品定制的动态链接子程序的源代码，例如，那些子程序和其他工作部分之间的频繁数据通信或控制流。

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
> 对应源不需要包含用户可以从对应源的其他部分自动重新生成的任何内容。

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
> 源代码形式的作品对应源代码与作品等价。

2. Basic Permissions.
> 2. 基本权限

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
> 根据本许可授予的所有权利均授予本程序的版权条款，并且只要符合所述条件即为不可撤销。本许可明确声明您无限制地运行未修改的程序。运行涵盖作品的输出包含在本许可证仅在输出内容构成涵盖作品时才受本许可证保护。本许可证承认版权法规定的合理使用权或其他同等权利。

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
> 只要您的许可证保持有效，您可以制作、运行和宣传您没有传达的涵盖作品。您可以向其他人传达涵盖作品，仅用于专门为您作出修改，或为您提供运行这些作品的设施，前提是您必须遵守本许可证的条款来传达您不受版权保护的所有材料。因此，必须在您直接指导和控制下完全代表您，来为您制作或运行涵盖作品，并禁止他们在与您的关系之外复制您版权材料的任何副本。

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
> 在任何其他情况下进行传播只能在下述条件下进行:不允许进行传播;第10节使它不必要。

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
> 3. 保护用户的合法权利免受反规避法律的影响

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
> 根据1996年12月20日通过的WIPO版权条约第11条规定的义务，或任何类似法律禁止或限制规避这些措施，任何适用法律均不应将任何涵盖作品视为有效技术措施的一部分。

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
> 当您转达涵盖作品时，您放弃任何合法权力禁止规避技术措施，只要此类规避是通过行使本许可下关于涵盖作品的权利而实现的，并且您无意将限制作品操作或修改作为一种强制手段来对抗作品使用者、您或第三方禁止规避技术措施的合法权利。

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
> 4. 传达逐字副本

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 您可以在任何媒体上传达您收到的本程序源代码的逐字副本，前提是您在每个副本上明显并恰当地发布了适当的版权声明；保留声明本许可证的所有通知，以及任何根据第7条添加的非许可条款；保持所有通知完整无缺；并随同本程序的副本，向所有收件人提供本许可证。

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
> 您可以为您传达的每个副本收取任何价格或不收取任何费用，并且您可以提供支付或保修保护以收取费用。

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
> 5. 传达修改后的源代码版本

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 根据第4节的条款，您可以以源程序的形式传送基于本程序的作品或从本程序生成的作品，前提是您还满足所有这些条件：

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
> a) 这项工作必须带有突出的通知，说明你修改了它，并给出了相关的日期。

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
> b) 该作品必须附有突出的通知，声明其是根据本许可证以及第7节添加的条件发布的。该要求修改了第4节中“保持所有通知完整无缺”的要求。

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
> c) 根据本许可证，您必须将整个作品作为整体许可给任何拥有副本的人。因此，本许可证连同任何适用的第7条附加条款适用于整个作品及其所有部分 ，无论它们是如何打包的。本许可证不允许以任何其他方式许可该作品，但是，如果您已单独收到该许可证，并不会使该许可无效。

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
> d) 如果作品具有交互式用户界面，则每个界面都必须显示适当的法律声明；但是，如果本程序具有不显示适当法律声明的交互式界面，则您的作品无需让他们这样做。

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
> 与其他独立和独立作品合作的作品的汇编，这些作品不是在被保护作品的本质上扩展，也不是与其结合在一起，例如在存储设备或分发媒体上形成一个更大的程序，并且，如果汇编及其所产生的版权不被用于在个人作品许可范围外限制汇编用户的访问权或合法权利，则被称为“汇总”。汇总涵盖的作品不会导致本许可证 适用于聚合的其他部分。

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
> 6. 传达非源代码形式

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
> 您可以按照第4节和第5节的条款以对象代码形式传达涵盖的作品，但您也可以通过以下方式之一在本许可条款下传送机器可读的对应源代码：

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
> a) 将对象代码传达或体现在物理产品（包括物理分布介质）中，并附带固定在通常用于软件交换的耐用物理介质上的对应源代码。

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
> b) 在实物产品（包括实物分销介质）中传递对象代码或附带书面报价，有效期至少为三年，只要您为该产品型号提供备件或客户支持 ，为拥有对象代码的任何人提供（1）本许可证涵盖的产品中所有软件的对应源代码副本，通常用于软件交换的耐用物理介质，价格不得超过 从网络服务器上免费复制对应的源代码的合理成本，或者（2）从网络服务器免费获取对应源的副本。

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
> c) 根据第6b条，将对象代码的单个副本与书面提议的副本一起传送，以提供相应的源代码。此替代方法仅允许偶尔和非商业性使用，并且仅当您根据第6b小节收到带有此类书面报价的对象代码时。

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
> d) 通过提供指定地点的访问（免费或收费）来传达对象代码，并在相同的地点以相同的方式提供对应源的相应资源，而无需支付额外费用。您无需要求收件人复制对象代码的对应源。如果复制对象代码的地方是网络服务器，对应源可能位于支持等效复制设施的其他服务器上（由您或第三方操作），您须针对对象代码清晰地说明在哪里查找对应的源代码。无论以何种服务器托管对应的源代码，您仍然有义务确保它只要需要即可满足这些要求。

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
> e) 使用对等传输传达目标代码，使您可以在告知其他同行的情况下根据第6d款免费向公众提供对象代码和作品对应源。

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.
> 对象代码的可分离部分，其源代码作为系统库从对应源中排除，在传送目标代码工作时不需要包含该部分。

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
> “用户产品”是（1）“消费品”，意指通常用于个人、家庭或家庭目的的任何有形个人财产，或（2）任何设计或销售用于并入住宅的物品。 确定产品是否为消费品时，应解决有疑问的情况以有利于覆盖。对于由特定用户接收的特定产品，“通常使用”是指该类产品的典型或通用用途，而不管特定用户或特定用户实际使用或期望或期望使用该产品的方式的状态。产品是消费产品，不管该产品是否具有实质的商业、工业或非消费者使用，除非这种用途代表产品使用的唯一重要模式。

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
> 用户产品的“安装信息”是指从其对应源的修改版本中安装和执行该用户产品中涵盖作品的修改版本所需的任何方法、过程、授权密钥或其他信息。信息必须足以确保修改后的对象代码的持续运行在任何情况下都不会因为修改而被阻止或干扰。

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
> 如果您根据本节中的对象代码作品在用户产品中，或与其一起使用或专门用于用户产品，并且传输是作为交易的一部分发生的，则将用户产品的拥有权和使用权转让给永久或固定期限的收款人（无论交易如何表征），根据本节传达的对应源必须附有安装信息，除非您和任何第三方都不具备在用户产品上安装修改的对象代码的能力（例如，工作已安装在ROM中）。

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
> 提供安装信息的要求不包括要求继续为收件人修改或安装的工作或修改或安装的用户产品提供支持服务，保修或更新。当修改本身对网络的操作产生重大不利影响或违反网络通信的规则和协议时，访问网络可能会被拒绝。

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
> 根据本节的规定，提供的对应源和安装信息必须采用公开记录的格式（并且以源代码的形式向公众提供使该实施可用），并且不需要特殊的密码或密钥进行解包、阅读或复制。

7. Additional Terms.
> 7. 附加条款

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
> “附加许可”是指通过对其一个或多个条件作出例外来补充本许可条款的条款。 适用于整个计划的其他许可应被视为包含在本许可中，只要它们在适用法律下有效。如果额外许可仅适用于部分计划，则该部分可以单独使用这些权限，但整个程序仍由本许可证管理，而不考虑其他权限。

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
> 当您传送一份涵盖作品的副本时，您可以选择删除该副本或其任何部分的任何附加许可（可能会编写额外的许可以在某些情况下在您修改作品时自行删除）。对于您拥有或可以给予适当的版权许可的作品，您可以对材料添加附加许可，并由您添加到涵盖作品中。

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
> 无论本许可证有任何其他规定，对于您添加到涵盖作品中的材料，您可以（如果该材料的版权所有者授权）以条款补充本许可证的条款：

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
> a) 以不同于本许可证第15和16条的条款为由拒绝保证或限制责任；或者

b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
> b) 要求保留该材料或包含它的作品所显示的适当法律通告中的指定合理法律通知或作者归属；或者

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
> c) 禁止错误陈述该材料的来源，或要求以与原始版本不同的合理方式标记此类材料的修改版本；或者

d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
> d) 限制用于宣传目的的许可人姓名或材料的作者名称；或者

e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
> e) 根据商标法授予使用某些商标名称，商标或服务商标的权利；或者

f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
> f) 任何以转让该材料（或其修改版本）的人及其对收件人承担责任的合同假设为由要求赔偿许可人和该材料作者的保障，以承担这些合同假定直接对这些许可人和作者造成的任何责任。

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
> 所有其他不允许的附加条款均被视为第10条含义范围内的“进一步限制”。如果您接收到的程序或者程序的任何部分，包含声明它受本许可证的管辖以及进一步限制的条款，您可以删除该条款。如果许可证文件包含进一步的限制，但允许根据本许可证进行重新许可或传输，则您可以添加到受该许可证文件条款约束的涵盖作品材料中，前提是进一步的限制不会在重新许可或传输中存在。

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
> 如果您按照本节的规定向涵盖作品添加条款，则必须在相关源文件中放置适用于这些文件的附加条款的声明或指示在哪里找到适用条款的声明。

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
> 无论是否许可的附加条款，都可以以单独书面许可的形式陈述，或作为例外陈述；上述要求适用于任何一种方式。

8. Termination.
> 8. 终止

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
> 除本许可明确规定的情况外，您不得传播或修改覆盖作品。任何其他企图传播或修改它的行为都是无效的，并且将自动终止您根据本许可的权利（包括根据第11节第3段授予的任何专利许可）。

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
> 但是，如果您停止违反本许可证的所有行为，那么您暂时恢复（a）暂时停止特定版权所有者的许可，除非版权所有者明确并最终终止您的许可，并且（b）永久恢复，如果版权持有人未在您停止违规行为后60天之前，以合理的方式通知您。

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
> 此外，如果版权所有者以某种合理的方式通知您此次侵权行为，您的特许版权所有者的许可将永久恢复，前提是，您是第一次收到来自该版权所有者的违反本许可（任何作品）的通知， 并且您在收到通知之后的30天内修正违规行为。

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
> 根据本节的规定，您终止您的权利并不终止根据本许可证收到您的副本或权利的当事人的许可。如果您的权利已终止并且未被永久恢复，则您无权获得在第10节下同一材料的新许可。

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
> 9. 无需承诺获取副本

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
> 您不需要接受本许可证即可接收或运行本程序的副本。仅因使用对等传输接收副本而发生的涵盖作品的附带传播同样无需接受。但是，只有本许可授权您传播或修改任何涵盖作品，如果您不接受本许可，则这些行为会侵犯版权。因此，通过修改或宣传涵盖作品，表明您接受此许可。

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
> 10. 下游收件人的自动许可

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
> 每次您传达涵盖作品时，收件人都会自动从原许可人处获得许可证，以运行、修改和传播该作品，但须遵守本许可证。您不负责执行第三方遵守本许可证的情况。

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
> “实体交易”是指组织的交易控制，或者实质上所有的资产，或者细分组织或合并组织的交易。如果被传播的作品来自实体交易，则交易的每一方 作品的复制品还可以获得该缔约方的前任利益已经或可能根据前一段所作出的作品的许可证，以及如果前任拥有或可以拥有来自前任利益方的作品的对应源的权利，以合理的努力得到它。

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
> 您不得对行使本许可中授予或确认的权利施加任何进一步限制。例如，您不得为执行本许可授予的权利而征收许可费、版税或其他费用，且您不得启动诉讼索赔（包括诉讼中的交叉索赔或反索赔）来指控通过制作、使用、销售、预售或进口本程序或其任何部分而受到侵害。

11. Patents.
> 11. 专利

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
> “贡献者”是根据本程序的许可或本程序所基于的作品授权使用的版权所有者。因此获得许可的作品称为作者的“贡献者版本”。

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
> 贡献者的“基本专利权利要求”是由贡献者拥有或控制的所有专利权利要求，不管是已经获得的还是未来获得的，该要求可能被本许可所允许的制作、使用或者销售贡献者版本所侵权，但不包括仅由于进一步修改贡献者版本而被侵权的声明。为了本定义的目的，“控制”包括以符合本许可证要求的方式授予专利子许可证的权利。

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
> 每个贡献者根据贡献者的基本专利权利要求授予您一个非独占的、全球性的、免版税的专利许可，以制作、使用、出售、预售、进口以其他方式修改和宣传其贡献者版本的内容。

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
> 在以下三段中，“专利许可”是指不强制执行专利的任何明确的协议或承诺（无论是许可专利权或不对专利侵权诉讼的合约）。“授予” 对某一方的这种专利许可，意味着作出不对该方执行专利的协议或承诺。

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients."Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
> 如果您传达的是明知依赖专利许可证的涵盖作品，并且任何人均无法通过公开提供的网络服务器或其他易于访问的软件免费复制并根据本许可证的条款进行复制，意味着你必须（1）使对应源可用，或者（2）安排剥夺你对这项特定作品的专利许可的利益，或者（3）以符合本许可要求的方式，将专利许可延伸至下游收件人。“明知依赖”意味着您对专利许可有实际的知识使您懂得：您在一个国家传达涵盖作品，或者您的收件人在一个国家使用涵盖作品，可能侵犯您有理由认为有效的该国的一项或多项可识别专利。

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
> 根据单一交易或安排有关，如果您通过采购传输工具传达或传播涵盖作品，并向接收涵盖作品的组织授权使用、传播、修改或传达涵盖作品的特定副本，那么您授予的专利许可将自动扩展到涵盖作品和作品的所有收件人。

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
> 如果专利许可不包含在其覆盖范围内、禁止行使或以不执行本许可明确授予的一项或多项权利为条件，则专利许可具有“歧视性”。您不得传达涵盖作品，如果您是分发软件业务第三方安排的当事人，您可以基于传达作品活动的活动从第三方获取收益，并且，第三方向任何能够从您那获取涵盖作品的当事人提供保证，那么歧视性专利许可（a）与您所传达的涵盖作品（或从这些副本制作的副本）相关的副本，或（b）除非您在2007年3月28日之前订立了该安排或授予了专利许可证，否则该专利产品或汇编包含该涵盖作品。

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
> 本许可中的任何内容均不得被解释为排除或限制任何隐含的许可或其他针对侵权的抗辩，否则根据适用的专利法可能对您适用侵权。

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
> 12. 不放弃他人的自由

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
> 如果违反本许可条款的规定（无论通过法院命令，协议或其他方式）对您施加了什么条件，他们不会原谅您违反本许可的条件。如果您无法传达涵盖作品以同时满足您根据本许可协议以及任何其他相关的义务，您可能根本不应传达该作品。例如，如果您同意有义务从进一步获取该程序的用户处收取版税的条款，唯一可以同时满足这些条款和本许可的方式是完全避免传达该程序。

13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
> 13. 远程网络交互；使用GNU通用公共许可证

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software.This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.
> 尽管本许可有任何其他规定，但如果您修改本程序，则修改后的版本必须通过计算机网络（如果您的版本支持此类交互）显着地让所有与其交互的用户，以免费从网络服务器访问“对应源”的方式，获取该版本的对应源，通过一些促进软件复制的标准或惯用手段，意味着便利地复制软件。此对应源应包括GNU通用公共许可证第3版涵盖的任何工作的“对应源” ，这些对应源根据以下段落组成。

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
> 尽管本许可证有任何其他规定，您有权将任何涵盖作品与第3版GNU通用公共许可证中许可的作品链接或合并为一个组合作品，并传达所产生的作品。本许可证的条款将继续适用于涵盖作品的部分，但与其合并的作品将继续受第3版GNU通用公共许可证的管辖。

14. Revised Versions of this License.
> 14. 本许可证的修订版本

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 自由软件基金会可能会不时发布GNU Affero通用公共许可证的修订版和/或新版本。这些新版本在精神上与现行版本相似，但可能会有所不同，以解决新问题或疑虑。

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
> 每个版本都有一个独特的版本号。如果本程序指定GNU Affero通用公共许可证的某个编号版本“或任何更高版本”适用于该版本，则您可以选择遵循该编号版本的条款和条件或自由软件基金会发布的任何后续版本。如果本程序未指定GNU Affero通用公共许可证的版本号，则可以选择自由软件基金会以前发布的任何版本。

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
> 如果本程序指定代理可以决定是否适用未来版本的GNU Affero通用公共许可证，那么代理公开声明接受版本将永久授权您为本程序选择该版本。

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
> 后来的许可版本可能会给您额外的或不同的许可。但是，由于您选择遵循更高版本，因此不会对任何作者或版权所有者承担额外义务。

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
> 15. 免责声明

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 在适用法律允许的范围内，对本程序不提供任何担保。除非另有说明，否则版权持有人和/或其他方按“原样”提供本程序，不提供任何明示或暗示的担保，包括但不限于对适销性和特定用途的适用性的默示保证。本程序的质量和性能的一切风险由您承担。如果程序证明存在缺陷，您应承担所有必要的服务、修补或更正。

16. Limitation of Liability.
> 16. 责任限制

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 在任何情况下，除非适用法律要求或书面同意，否则任何版权所有者或任何修改和/或运行上述许可程序的其他方均不对您承担任何损失，包括任何一般的、特殊的、偶发的或因使用或无法使用本程序而导致的后果性的损失（包括但不限于数据丢失，或数据不准确，或您或第三方所持续的损失，或本程序不能与任何其他程序一起运行所造成的损失），即使 此类持有人或其他方已被告知此类损害的可能性。

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
> 17. 解释第15和16节

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
> 如果上述保证的免责声明和责任限制不能根据其条款给予当地法律效力，则审查法院应适用当地法律，该法律应与本程序有关的绝对免除所有民事责任的情况最接近，除非保证或假设 的责任随同本程序的副本一起收取费用。

## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 如何将条款应用到您的新程序中

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 如果您开发了一个新程序，并且希望它能够最大限度地为公众所用，那么实现这一目标的最佳方法是使其成为免费软件，每个人都可以在这些条款下重新分配和更改。

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
> 为此，请将以下通知附加到程序中。将它们附加到每个源文件的起始处以最有效地说明排除任何保证是最安全的；并且每个文件应该至少有“版权”行和指向完整通知的指针。
